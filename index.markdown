<p>The Dear Canada Project has three primary objectives. Firstly, it aims to establish a comprehensive reference index dedicated to archiving historical or less common terminology found within the texts. These terms may be unfamiliar to readers due to their historical contexts or regional disparities in language usage. Secondly, the project endeavors to meticulously map out all the locations referenced in the texts. Thirdly, it seeks to construct a dynamic timeline encompassing the events depicted in the books. To accomplish these goals, I employed a range of digital humanities methodologies, spanning from XML text encoding to HTML website design.</p>
