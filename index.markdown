<p>The aim of this project is to develop a website dedicated to cataloging a <a href="https://likethetree.github.io/reference/">reference list</a> of keywords extracted from the Dear Canada books, and plotting the books on a map, and timeline. These terms may be unfamiliar to readers due to their association with historical items and concepts that are no longer prevalent today, or simply because they are not commonly used in the reader's region. I utilized a text-encoding web-program named Leaf-Writer to annotate all potentially perplexing terms within the text. Subsequently, I linked each of these annotations to my comprehensive reference list, ensuring accessibility and clarity for all readers.Ultimately, my objective with this project is to encode all 33 books in the Dear Canada series, furnishing them with links to this reference list. This will facilitate effortless access to unfamiliar terms, thereby aiding individuals in expanding their knowledge and understanding.</p>
