<p>Happy Valentine’s Day!</p>

<p>I have an idea.</p>

<p>In class we’re learning about various ways to do computational analysis and data visualisation. Most of the examples we’ve looked at involve fictional books and now I’m wondering what I could do with the Dear Canada books. First I’ll need digital copies of all of them. I have all the physical books but unfortunately they are at home in Calgary. Dad can probably help me with digital copies, I’ll ask him. </p>

<p>Later</p>

<p>Success. I have all the epubs and I converted them all to plain-text with a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/epub2txt/">python script</a> dad found. Now I can use them for pretty much anything. Cool!</p>
