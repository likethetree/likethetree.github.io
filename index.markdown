Hello! My name is Acacia and I really love diaries and Canadian history! When I was in middle school I found my first "Dear Canada" book in my school library and, over a decade later, I still absolutely adore them. These books developed my passion for learning and teaching history! 

I am currently advancing my studies toward a Master's degree in Education in Museums and Heritage via the Erasmus Mundus Consortium. My academic journey has led me through the pathway at UCC in Cork, where I've delved into a diverse array of Digital Humanities tools and technologies. As part of a recent assignment, I seized the chance to apply the skills I've honed in class to create a digital resource. Allow me to present my project!

The aim of this project is to develop a website dedicated to cataloging a <a href="https://likethetree.github.io/reference/">reference list</a> of keywords extracted from the Dear Canada books. These terms may be unfamiliar to readers due to their association with historical items and concepts that are no longer prevalent today, or simply because they are not commonly used in the reader's region. I utilized a text-encoding web-program named Leaf-Writer to annotate all potentially perplexing terms within the text. Subsequently, I linked each of these annotations to my comprehensive reference list, ensuring accessibility and clarity for all readers.Ultimately, my objective with this project is to encode all 33 books in the Dear Canada series, furnishing them with links to this reference list. This will facilitate effortless access to unfamiliar terms, thereby aiding individuals in expanding their knowledge and understanding.
