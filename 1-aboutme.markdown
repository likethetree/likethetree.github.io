Hello! My name is Acacia and I really love diaries and Canadian history! When I was in middle school I found my first "Dear Canada" book in my school library and, over a decade later, I still absolutely adore them. These books helped develop my passion for learning and teaching history! 

I am currently advancing my studies toward a Master's degree in Education in Museums and Heritage via the Erasmus Mundus Consortium. My academic journey has led me through the pathway at UCC in Cork, where I've delved into a diverse array of Digital Humanities tools and technologies. As part of a recent assignment, I seized the chance to apply the skills I've honed in class to create a digital resource. Allow me to present my project!
