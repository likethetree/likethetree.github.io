<img src="/images/sod house.jpg" alt="Typical Canadian Sod House">
<p>"Back in the 1800s and early 1900s, when people were settling in the Great Plains of Canada and the United States, they often used sod houses, also called soddy, instead of log cabins. These houses were made from thick, tough roots of prairie grass, which were abundant and free in those areas where trees and stones were scarce. Originally, people used sod for things like animal shelters and fences, but they found it could also be used to build houses. Prairie grass has a really strong root system, much tougher than the grass in our lawns today, making it a good building material for those early settlers."</p>

But it's not just for fun—some Indigenous peoples in northern Canada, like the Innu and Cree, have been using toboggans as a way to get around in snowy areas for ages. They're like big sleds that can carry people and things over snow-covered ground, making them really useful for traveling in those cold and snowy places."</p>
