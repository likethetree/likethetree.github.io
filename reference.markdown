Bobbed Hair <img style="float: left; padding-right: 10px" src="images/A Prairie as Wide as the Sea Reference/bob.jpg"> A bob cut, also known as a bob, is a short to medium length haircut, in which the hair is typically cut straight around the head at approximately jaw level, and no longer than shoulder-length, often with a fringe at the front. The standard bob cut exposes the back of the neck and keeps all of the hair well above the shoulders. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_cut)
