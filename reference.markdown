<h2>Box Social</h2><a id="box-social"></a>
<img src="/images/box social.webp" alt="Box Social">
<p>In this tradition, women make special decorated boxes and fill them with lunch or dinner for two people. Then, men bid on these boxes, hoping to win a meal with the woman who made it. The catch is, the boxes are usually anonymous, so the men don't know whose box they're bidding on or what's inside. This adds a fun mystery element to the event, and sometimes the women drop hints to their favorite men about which box is theirs. The bidding involves lots of teasing, joking, and friendly competition. These events often happen in places like town halls, school gyms, or church halls, where everyone can gather and have a good time together.</p>

<h2>Caragana Leaves</h2><a id="caragana"></a>
<img src="/images/caragana.jpg" alt="Caragana Leaves">
<p>Caragana arborescens, also known as the Siberian peashrub or caragana, is a plant that comes from places like Siberia, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. People from Eurasia brought it to the United States a long time ago and used it for food while they traveled west. But, in some parts of the United States, it's seen as a problem because it grows too much and takes over other plants. In the 1880s, it was brought to the Canadian prairies where it became really popular. This tough plant helped by giving animals homes, keeping soil from washing away, and stopping snow from piling up too much.</p>

<h2>Carbolic Acid</h2><a id="carbolic-acid"></a>
<img src="/images/carbolic.jpg" alt="Carbolic Acid">

It looks like tiny white crystals and can easily turn into vapor. The molecule of phenol has a part called a phenyl group and another part called a hydroxy group. It's a bit acidic, so it needs to be handled with care because it can hurt your skin if you're not careful. Phenol was commonly used as a type of antiseptic, which means it helped keep things clean and kill germs. It's also used to make a special kind of soap called carbolic soap, which has extra cleaning power because of the phenol in it.</p>

They had speakers, teachers, musicians, performers, and experts who shared their knowledge and skills with everyone who came.

<p>"Colonist cars were special train cars designed to help people move to faraway places in North America during the 1800s and early 1900s. Back then, lots of people were moving to new places in the western part of the continent, which were really far from the places where ships arrived with immigrants. These cars started in the 1840s as the cheapest way for immigrants to travel. They were pretty basic, usually just benches inside what were usually regular boxcars. Sometimes, these boxcars were used for carrying grains back to the east coast after dropping off people."</p>

They had a unique style: they wore short skirts, cut their hair short, and loved listening to jazz music. They didn't care much for the traditional rules of behavior and often did things that were considered daring at the time. For example, they wore a lot of makeup, drank alcohol, smoked cigarettes in public, drove cars, and were open about their relationships. As cars became more common, flappers enjoyed more freedom to go where they pleased and do what they wanted.</p>

<h2>Great Auk</h2><a id="great-auk"></a>
<img src="/images/great auk.jpg" alt="Great Auk Illustration">
<p>The great auk was a type of bird that couldn't fly, and sadly, it went extinct in the middle of the 19th century. It was the only kind of bird in its group called the genus Pinguinus. Even though it was called a penguin by sailors, it's not closely related to the penguins we know today from the Southern Hemisphere. Those penguins were discovered later and got their name because they looked similar to the great auk, which sailors had already called penguins.</p>

<h2>Hobby Horse</h2><a id="hobby-horse"></a>

<h2>Jack Horner Tart</h2><a id="jack-horner-tart"></a>
<img src="/images/jack horner tart.jpg" alt="Jack Horner Game">
<p>A plum tart called "Little Jack Horner" is inspired by an English nursery rhyme. The rhyme, also called "Little Jack Horner," has been around since the 18th century. It's a catchy little song that's been linked to opportunistic behavior, especially in politics. So, the tart might be named after the rhyme because it's a fun and whimsical nod to the past!"</p>

<h2>Kapok</h2><a id="kapok"></a>
<img src="/images/kapok.webp" alt="Kapok">
<p>Kapok is a special kind of material that's a lot like cotton. It's made up of tiny fibers that grow inside fruit pods. These fibers are short, about 10 to 35 millimeters long, and they're a bit brittle because they have lignin in them. Usually, kapok fibers are mixed with other fibers, like cotton, before they can be spun into thread. Kapok fibers don't like water much, and they're great at keeping things warm. They can be white, light gray, or yellowish-brown in color. While they break down easily in nature, bugs don't bother them much.</p>

It's different from a riding school because it's not for lessons, and the horses aren't rented out for riding.

<h2>Sod House</h2><a id="sod-house"></a>

<p>"Back in the 1800s and early 1900s, when people were settling in the Great Plains of Canada and the United States, they often used sod houses, also called soddy, instead of log cabins. These houses were made from thick, tough roots of prairie grass, which were abundant and free in those areas where trees and stones were scarce. Originally, people used sod for things like animal shelters and fences, but they found it could also be used to build houses. Prairie grass has a really strong root system, much tougher than the grass in our lawns today, making it a good building material for those early settlers."</p>
