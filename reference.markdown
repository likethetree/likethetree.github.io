<h2>Box Social</h2><a id="box-social"></a>
<img src="/images/box social.jpg" alt="Box Social">
<p>In this tradition, women make special decorated boxes and fill them with lunch or dinner for two people. Then, men bid on these boxes, hoping to win a meal with the woman who made it. The catch is, the boxes are usually anonymous, so the men don't know whose box they're bidding on or what's inside. This adds a fun mystery element to the event, and sometimes the women drop hints to their favorite men about which box is theirs. The bidding involves lots of teasing, joking, and friendly competition. These events often happen in places like town halls, school gyms, or church halls, where everyone can gather and have a good time together.</p>

<h2>Caragana Leaves</h2><a id="caragana"></a>
<img src="/images/caragana.jpg" alt="Caragana Leaves">
<p>Caragana arborescens, also known as the Siberian peashrub or caragana, is a plant that comes from places like Siberia, China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan. People from Eurasia brought it to the United States a long time ago and used it for food while they traveled west. But, in some parts of the United States, it's seen as a problem because it grows too much and takes over other plants. In the 1880s, it was brought to the Canadian prairies where it became really popular. This tough plant helped by giving animals homes, keeping soil from washing away, and stopping snow from piling up too much.</p>

Originally, people used sod for things like animal shelters and fences, but they found it could also be used to build houses. Prairie grass has a really strong root system, much tougher than the grass in our lawns today, making it a good building material for those early settlers."</p>
